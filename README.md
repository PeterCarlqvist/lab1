This is my report for lab 1 for the HTML course.

It is easy to create a webpage. However, the styling can be frustrating. Turning the vision of your webpage
to reality requires patience and a lot of CSS.

I created the webpage stepwise. First adding the required HTML
elements and then styling. For the styling I used web resources and
trial and error.

As the website develops it becomes easier as I can reuse code to make the website look cohesive.
Each new page is easier to develop.
